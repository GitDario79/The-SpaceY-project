# The-SpaceY-project
In this projet I will play the role of Data Scientist for the fictional company SpaceY, trying to compete with SpaceX.


The primary goal of the project is to determine the price of each launch. A key factor in launch cost is the reuse of the first stage of the rocket, which significantly reduces expenses. SpaceX, unlike other providers, can recover its first stage.
The main tasks in this project will be:

•Gathering information about SpaceX.
•Creating dashboards for your team.
•Determining if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

I will train a machine learning model using public information to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage. This prediction is crucial because if the first stage can land successfully, the launch cost is lower. Sometimes the first stage does not land, or it is sacrificed due to mission parameters like payload or orbit.

The project draws inspiration from the commercial space age, where companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and especially SpaceX, are making space travel more affordable. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is highlighted for its relatively inexpensive launches, priced around $62 million, compared to others that can cost upwards of $165 million, largely because of the first stage reuse. Understanding if the first stage will land is key to understanding the cost.
